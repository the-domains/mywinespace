Honest Grapes Taste Lab Test!

With lots of online wine retailers competing for your attention and hard earned cash, it's becoming more and more difficult for these folk to stand out from the crowd. 
Wine is a very personal purchase and everyone is different. Buying wine outside of supermarkets is less about good (well made and with character) and bad (cheap, nasty, manufactured plonk) wine and more about buying nice wine, i.e. wines you like.
The benefit of a bricks and mortar wine shop is you have a human being to interact with, to discuss what you do and don't like and to build a relationship with where they hold your hand through a discovery of new and interesting wines. 
Honest Grapes (www.honestgrapes.co.uk) have a very interesting way of trying to bridge the gap between human interaction and online retailer - it's their Taste Lab. The idea is simple but brilliant; a selection of 5 red and 5 white wines that you taste without knowing what they are, make notes on elements that you do / don't like and they use this information to understand your profile and make wine recommendations. Genius? Quite possibly - we thought we should try it out.
The cost of the kit is Â£29 which might seem like a lot. When it arrived we quickly realised that this is actually a very well priced investment on helping you understand more about wine and what melts your butter. The kit looks very slick, well packaged in fancy black corrugated cardboard, the wine samples in sophisticated looking viles and the instructions are detailed and clear. You need 5 suitable glasses for each tasting and need to follow the instructions carefully.
